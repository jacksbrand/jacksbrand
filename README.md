👋 Hi, I’m Jack.

🏍️ Javascript engineer; 🧑‍⚖️ Ex solicitor trainee.

I have a love for all things automated and machine learned. My profile picture is what my anime-self would look like according to a computer. The scary thing is, I wasn't wearing any glasses when I took that picture... He definately looks to be a villan 🦹
