👋 Hi, I’m Jack.

🏍️ Mechanical Sympathist; 🧑‍⚖️ Narrowly avoided qualifying as a solicitor.

🗺️ I am currently working on a project related to maps which I look forward to sharing with the world 🌎. 

I have a side passion for all things automated and machine learned. I wasn't wearing any glasses when a computer generated my profile picture.. 'definitely looks to be a villan 🦹.
