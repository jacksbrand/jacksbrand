👋 Hi, I’m Jack.

🏍️ Javascript engineer; 🧑‍⚖️ Narrowly avoided qualifying as a solicitor 😅.

🗺️ I am currently working on a secret project to do with mapping which I look forward to sharing with the world 🌎. 

I have a side passion for all things automated and machine learned. I wasn't wearing any glasses when a computer generated my profile picture.. 'definately looks to be a villan 🦹.
